## Technical Implementation

### Semantic Analysis Engine
The `RealTimeLLMService` class provides advanced semantic analysis:

```python
class RealTimeLLMService:
    def analyze_resume_realtime(self, resume_text: str, job_description_text: str) -> Dict
    def _analyze_text_semantically(self, text: str) -> Dict
    def _calculate_realtime_match(self, resume_analysis: Dict, jd_analysis: Dict) -> Dict
```

### Key Improvements Over Previous System
